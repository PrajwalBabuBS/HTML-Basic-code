            <h2 class="section-title">What is a Programming Language?</h2>
            <p class="description">
                A programming language is a formal set of instructions that can be used to produce a variety of outputs. 
                It is the medium through which developers communicate with a computer to perform specific tasks. 
                Programming languages consist of syntax (rules of grammar) and semantics (meaning). They allow us to write 
                programs that can control the behavior of a machine, solve problems, and automate repetitive tasks.

            <p class="description">
                Programming languages can be categorized based on their functionality and purpose. Below are some common types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-item">High-Level Languages: These languages are closer to human languages and are easy to read and write. Examples include Python, Java, and JavaScript.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Low-Level Languages: These languages are closer to machine code and are harder for humans to read and write but offer more control over hardware. Examples include Assembly and C.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Scripting Languages: These are typically used for automating tasks. Examples include JavaScript, Python, and Bash.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Markup Languages: These are used to structure data and include languages like HTML and XML.</li>
